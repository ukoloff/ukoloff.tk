Personal site built with Gulp.

## Story

First, this site was hosted on GitHub Pages using Jekyll.
But since I personally prefer JavaScript to Ruby I was happy
to switch to DocPad.

But time passes and eventually DocPad became
more Microsoft-ish then Microsoft itself.
A whole lot of abstractions with no
practical purpose,
ridiculous building time,
outdated documentation etc etc...

This was a great excuse to try something different.
By chance it turned out to be Metalsmith.
Not very popular,
but very practical,
extremely *simple*,
fast and lightweight.

And finally
(*so far*)
I decided to test Gulp.
Far more popular
and as practical as
its predecessor.
Here it is!

Old version are in
  - [Jekyll](../../tree/jekyll/) branch.
  - [DocPad](../../tree/docpad/) branch.
  - [Metalsmith](../../tree/metalsmith/) branch.
